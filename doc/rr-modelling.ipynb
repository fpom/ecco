    "A model consists of a series of sections, each has a name followed by a colon and an indented block that is its content. The first sections have freely chosen names (above `inhabitants`, `structures`, `resources`, and `competitors`) and define the variables of the models, the two last sections (`constraints` and `rules`) define the evolution rules of the model.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A model has Boolean variables, each of which having a name, an initial state, and a description. For instance, `Rp+: reproductive` defines a variable called `Rp`, whose initial state is on (`+`), and whose description is `reproductives`. Similarly, `Wk-: workers` defines a variable called `Wk`, whose initial state is off (`-`), and whose description is `workers`. Separating the variables definitions into sections and providing descriptions has no consequences on the semantics but may be useful to clarify the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evolution rules\n",
    "\n",
    "Each rule or constraint describes a possible evolution in the system and consists of a left-hand side that is a condition for its execution, and a right-hand side that is an assignement of some variables to be done upon the execution of the rule or constraint. For instance, rule `Ac+, Sd- >> Wk-, Rp-` has left-hand side `Ac+, Sd-` that states that the rule may be executed when variable `Ac` is on and variable `Sd` is off, and a right-had side `Wk-, Rp-` that states that if the rule is executed, then `Wk` and `Rp` are both set to off (regardless of their previous state). This could be read as _when ant competitors are present and no soldier is present, workers and reproductives may be killed_, but this could be as well interpreted as _when too much ant competitors are present and not enough soldiers are present, then most workers and reproductives may be killed_ which is a more quantitative interpretation of the Boolean setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints vs rules\n",
    "\n",
    "The only difference between constraints and rules is that the former have a higher priority than the latter: if a constraint can be executed then no rule is allowed to be executed, or in other words, a rule can be executed only if no constraint can. A model may have no constraints in which case the corresponding section is completely omitted. Constraints are usually used to model quick or mandatory processes in an ecosystem, typically, when then place where some species live disappear, then the species have to disappear has well (eg, fishes in a pond will die if the pond dries). In our termites example, termitomicies cannot exist without a fungal garden, hence the constraint.\n",

This is a more precise representation that actually loses only the description of the variables and their dispatching into sections (these informations are actually only for the modeller but carry no semantical meaning). In this representation, round-shaped nodes are the variables, and square-shaped nodes are the rules and constraints (the latter being displayed with a yellow background). An edge links a rule/constraint with each variables that is used in it, a white (resp. black) dot represents a sign `-` (resp. `+`), and the left-hand side of the rule corresponds to the rule-side of the edge, while the right-hand side corresponds to the variable-side of the edge. See for instance how rule R9, that is `Ac+, Sd- >> Wk-, Rp-` is rendered."

    "A rule or constraint may be executed from a state `s` if its left-hand side is validated by `s`. For example, in the initial state of our termites model (that could be written as `{Rp+, Ac+}`, all the other variables being off), only rules `Rp+ >> Ec+` and `Ac+, Sd- >> Wk-, Rp-` may be executed. Executing a rule or constraint yields a state that is obtained by assigning the variables as instructed by the right-hand side of the executed rule of constraint. For instance, executing `Rp+ >> Ec+` from the initial state `{Rp+, Ac+}` yields state `{Rp+, Ac+, Ec+}`, while executing `Ac+, Sd- >> Wk-, Rp-` from the same state yields state `{Ac+}`.\n",

    "The semantics of a `rr` model is a state-space, that is a graph whose nodes are the states that can be reached by executing rules or constraints, and whose edges are labelled with the rules or constraints allowing to reach one state from another. It can be constructed as follows:\n",
