    "Method `model.inline` allows to suppress constraints by inlining them into the rules. The idea is that each rule that may enable the execution of a constraint to be inlined is augmented with the right-hand side of the constraint, and possibly with its left-hand side if the rule's condition is not larger that the constraint's condition. Because of the possible augmentation of the left-hand side, a rule may be transformed into several: one that fully validates the condition of the constraint, and (potentially) several that do not validate it. For instance, is we have a constraint is `A+, B+, C+ >> X+` and a rule `A+ >> Z+`, then the rule may yield a state with `A+` that potentially validates the constraints condition. Thus, it will be converted into several rules:\n",
