    "# `ecco` state-space analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we see how the state-space of a `rr` model can be computed and analysed symbolically. By _symbolically_ we refer to the use of decision diagrams to represent sets of states in a compact way. More specifically, `ecco` uses [`libDDD` and `libITS`](https://lip6.github.io/ITSTools-web) as its basis for state-space representation and computation. The main benefit of such symbolic methods is that `ecco` can handle very large state-spaces, for models with tens of variables and more, while always maintaining a readable view of the model. However, a consequence is that the individual states are not shown during the analysis. (Another notebook will show how `ecco` can handle explicit state-spaces, that is state-space representations in which individual states are explicitely enumerated.)\n",
